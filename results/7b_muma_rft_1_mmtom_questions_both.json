However, the sequence of actions Mark takes in the kitchen suggests he is looking for something specific. He opens the seventh cabinet, which contains an apple, and then proceeds to the fridge, where he opens it. The fridge contains a dish bowl, a plate, and a bottle of wine. Given that the fridge is the last item Mark checks and it contains a plate, it is more likely that Mark was trying to get a plate.\n</think>\n<answer>\nb\n</answer>",

However, Susan's actions do not seem to be focused on retrieving the salmon. Instead, she is opening and closing different cabinets, which could be a part of a search or a routine activity. The presence of a water glass in the dishwasher and on the kitchen tables suggests that Susan might be looking for a water glass, as it is a common item to search for in a kitchen. Therefore, it is more likely that Susan has been trying to get a water glass.\n</think>\n<answer>\nb\n</answer>",
